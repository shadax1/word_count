# Word Count

Hello and Welcome!

## How to use?
From the Command Palette:
- `Count Specific Words` opens a panel on the right where the user can then enter words to be counted,
- `Copy Word Counters` from that same panel, copies all words and their counters into the clipboard,
- `Sort Words By Counters` sorts all words in an ascending or descending order based on the counters.
