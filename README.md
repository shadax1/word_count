# word_count
Sublime Text plugin written in Python that counts words, given by the user, from a text or file.

## How?
By simply using the `Ctrl+Alt+Space` hotkey, a panel on the right will show up and the user can then enter words to be counted.

Here is a brief demo:

## Misc
After almost a decade of using Sublime Text, I decided to finally try writing a plugin for a feature I always needed but wasn't able to find in the current package list.
I watched a few of OdatNurd's [youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGfKZJVuHW91zln4ADyZA3sxGEmq32Wse) to get started as well as google search (a lot) and use Sublime Text's [forum](https://forum.sublimetext.com/).

## Ideas/Improvements
The execution for this plugin isn't really the best but it does the job for me at the moment.
Potential ideas I have to make this a little better:
- sort all the words based on how many times they appear,
- ability to copy the contents of the word counts. Since I am using phantoms, I don't think there is a way to get text out of them.
