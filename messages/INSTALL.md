# Word Count

Hello and Welcome!

## How to use?
From the Command Palette:
- `Count Specific Words` opens a panel on the right where the user can then enter words to count,
- `Copy Word Counters` from that same panel, copies all words and their counters into the clipboard,
- `Sort Words By Counters` sorts all words in an ascending or descending order based on the counters.

It's also possible to switch the `Whole word` and `Case sensitive` flags between `0` or `1` to disable or enable them respectively.
